Stevens Institute of Technology Individual Software Engineering

## Description

In this course students learn to practice a disciplined engineering process for developing software. Individual skills and practices, such as effort estimation and unit testing, are mastered so that students can become successful members of software engineering teams. Best practices in software engineering are followed, including the use of simple design patterns with well-known properties. Students work in small teams to construct a simple web service using the industry standard Ruby programming language, Rails framework and MySQL database technology.

## Shut-the-Box
Rules:
- There are 2 players each with 9 tiles labeled 1 through 9.
- The object of the game is to turn over all 9 tiles by rolling dice.
- At the beginning the first player rolls 2 die. Letâ€™s say the player rolls a 2 and a 3. The player can either turn over tile 5 or tiles 2 and 3. Then the second player rolls and turns over tiles...this continues until one player turns over all the tiles or the players go a round of turns with each player unable to turn over a tile. If that happens you start over. 
- If a player turns over all the tiles greater than 6, then the player rolls one die from that point, going forward.
