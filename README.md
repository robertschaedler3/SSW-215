## Shut-the-Box
Rules:
- There are 2 players each with 9 tiles labeled 1 through 9.
- The object of the game is to turn over all 9 tiles by rolling dice.
- At the beginning the first player rolls 2 die. Letâ€™s say the player rolls a 2 and a 3. The player can either turn over tile 5 or tiles 2 and 3. Then the second player rolls and turns over tiles...this continues until one player turns over all the tiles or the players go a round of turns with each player unable to turn over a tile. If that happens you start over. 
- If a player turns over all the tiles greater than 6, then the player rolls one die from that point, going forward.
